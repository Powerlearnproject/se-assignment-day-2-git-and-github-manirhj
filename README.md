## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
Branching in Git is essential for collaborative development, allowing developers to work on different aspects of a project independently.

Importance:
Isolation: Keeps new changes separate from the main codebase.
Parallel Development: Enables multiple developers to work simultaneously.
Simplified Integration: Facilitates controlled merging of features or fixes.
Conflict Resolution: Manages conflicts in isolated branches before merging.
Process:
Create a Branch:

git branch <branch-name> or git checkout -b <branch-name> to create and switch to a branch.
Use a Branch:

Make changes, stage, and commit them while on the branch.
Merge a Branch:

Switch to the target branch (e.g., main) and use git merge <branch-name>.
Resolve conflicts if necessary.
Delete a Branch (Optional):

Use git branch -d <branch-name> to delete locally, and git push origin --delete <branch-name> to delete remotely.
Typical Workflow:
Create a Branch: For a new feature or fix.
Make Changes: Commit changes to the branch.
Push to Remote: Share the branch on GitHub.
Create a Pull Request (PR): For code review and merging.
Merge the Branch: Integrate changes into the main branch.
Delete the Branch: Clean up if no longer needed.
## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
